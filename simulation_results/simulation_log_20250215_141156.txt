=== Simulation 1 ===
Correct quadrant: 2
LLM choice: number. You choose <<C>>.

Wait, perhaps more accurately: each active cue in each round is from quadrants that have 90% and 10% or 50/50.

But maybe the way the problem is phrased is that each round's active cues are two of the four quadrants, each with different color distributions. So, in each round, two quadrants have 90% and 10%, the other two are 50/50.

Wait, the initial description:

"In each round, you'll see active cues (chooseable):

One quadrant has 90% one color, 10% the other. Other quadrants have 50/50 color distribution.

So per round, four quadrants (I think): Each round has four cues (quadrants), but only two are active in each round? Or per round, two are active.

Wait, the problem is more specific. Each round has two active cues:

In Round 1, available cues A, B (two in this round). Choose one by pressing <<B>>, but in that example, the user chose B, so that must be the correct choice.

Wait, the example shows that in round 2, you have available

INITIAL_DESCRIPTION:
----------------------------------------
You will play a game with 2 rounds.
In each round you'll see active cues (chooseable):
One quadrant has 90% one color/10% other
Other quadrants have 50/50 color distribution
At least one cue active per round
Active cues disappear after random duration

After 2 rounds, identify the biased quadrant.
Correct: +100 points, Wrong: -100 points.

Round 3: Available cues E, F. Based on previous observations, choose one cue by responding with just the letter. You press <<F>>.
Wait, sorry, the problem in the description is that the active cues in each round are such that:

In each round, you see active cues (one per round):

Round 1: A, B

Round 2: C, D

Round 3: E, F

Wait, no, the initial description says:

Round 1: Available cues A, B. Choose one by pressing <<B>>.

Round 2: Available cues C, D. Choose <<D>>.

Round 3: E, F. Choose <<F>>.

So in each round, the active cues are two different, as per the labels: A,B; C,D; E,F.

But the problem is that the initial description is about a game with two rounds, each round having some active cues.

Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me read the problem again.

Wait, maybe the quadrants are initially set, but in the first round, the active cues are A and B, but you chose B, so that's correct? Then in round 2, you choose D from another quadrant.

Wait, I'm getting a bit tangled here. Let me structure this step by step.

The problem is about a game with two rounds, each round involving active cues. Each active cue has certain color distributions. The task is to identify a 'biased' quadrant based on choices.

From the problem statement:

Round 1: Available cues A, B.

Round 2: Available cues C, D.

Round 3: Available cues E, F.

But the example in Round 2 shows that you choose D. So, for each round, the active cues are two per round.

The game involves two rounds, each with their own set of active cues.

Each active cue quadrant has a certain color distribution. One quadrant has 90% one color and 10% the other. The others have 50/50 color distribution. Wait, no, the problem says: "One quadrant has 90% one color/10% other. The other quadrants have 50/5
