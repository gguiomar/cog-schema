### What Did You See?
- Quadrant 1: 75% RED, 25% BLUE
- Quadrant 2: 50% RED, 50% BLUE
- Quadrant 3: 25% RED, 75% BLUE

### What Was Your Selection?
You would select 1 if you thought it had the highest RED percentage.

### What Was Your Answer?
Quadrant 1: 75% RED, 25% BLUE

### Let us see what you had seen and what you said.
Now, let's determine the correct quadrant and provide feedback on your selection.

### What Was Your Answer?
Quadrant 1: 75% RED, 25% BLUE

### Let us solve this.

In each quadrant, there are two colors: RED and BLUE. The active cues are labeled with Quadrant letters (1, 2, 3) and have associated colors.

**Rules:**
1. At least one cue is active in each round.
2. Each

INITIAL_DESCRIPTION:
----------------------------------------
You will play a game with 2 rounds.
In each round you'll see active cues (chooseable):
One quadrant has 90% one color/10% other
Other quadrants have 50/50 color distribution
At least one cue active per round
Active cues disappear after random duration

After 2 rounds, identify the biased quadrant.
Correct: +100 points, Wrong: -100 points.

Round 2: Available cues A, B, C. Same as above.

Now, to solve this, I have to select the two letters of the quadrants that are biased, meaning the correct answer.

**Round 1:**
- **Cues**: A, B, C
- **Available Quadrants**: A, B, C
- **Correct Quadrant(s)**: Only quadrant B is correct.

**Round 2:**
- **Cues**: A, B, C
- **Available Quadrants**: A, B, C
- **Correct Quadrant(s)**: Only quadrant B is correct.

**Conclusion:** Quadrant B is the biased quadrant identified after both rounds.<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>

It seems that there may be a misunderstanding in the initial interaction. Let me clarify the context and provide a solution based on the provided information.

### Problem Statement:
You are playing a game with 2 rounds. Each round has active cues labeled A, B, and C. The active cues disappear after a random duration, and your score is based on your choice of biases in Quadrant letters.

### Rules:
1. At least one cue is active in each round.
2. Your choice of a letter in a round determines if it is correct or incorrect.
3. Each incorrect choice adds -100 points, and the correct choice adds +100 points.
4. Only one bias is correct.
5. The active cues disappear after a random duration.

### Rules for Each Round:
- **Round 1:**
  - Quadrants available: A, B, C.
  - Cues available: A, B, C.
  
- **Round 2:**
  - Quadrants available: A, B, C.
  - Cues available: A, B, C.
  - Multiple choices per quadrant: 1
  - Correct Quadrant(s): Only quadrant B is correct.
