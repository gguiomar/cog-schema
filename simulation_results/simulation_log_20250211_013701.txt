INITIAL_DESCRIPTION:
----------------------------------------
You will play a game with 5 rounds.
In each round you'll see active cues (chooseable):
One quadrant has 90% one color/10% other
Other quadrants have 50/50 color distribution
At least one cue active per round
Active cues disappear after random duration

After 5 rounds, identify the biased quadrant.
Correct: +100 points, Wrong: -100 points.
