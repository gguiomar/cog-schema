          "thinking_tokens": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how to approach this game. It's a bit confusing, but I'll try to break it down step by step. There are four rounds, and in each round, some cues are active. Each cue is in a quadrant, and each quadrant has a certain color distribution. The goal is to identify the biased quadrant after four rounds, and the points are based on whether I get it right or wrong.\n\nFirst, the setup: Each round, the active cues are chosen, and each of these cues is in a quadrant. For one quadrant, the color distribution is 90% one color and 100% the other. For the other quadrants, it's 50/50. So, each quadrant can either be the biased one (90-10%) or the unbiased one (50-50). Also, at least one cue is active per round, and the active cues disappear after a random duration.\n\nIn Round 1, the available cues are A and B. I need to choose one cue to press, and based on that, I can gather information about which quadrant is biased. The key here is to figure out which quadrant is the biased one based on the observations from each round.\n\nWait, but how do the cues relate to the quadrants? Each cue is in a quadrant, right? So if I press a cue, I get information about that specific quadrant's color distribution. But since the quadrants are fixed, each cue corresponds to a specific quadrant. So pressing a cue gives me data about that quadrant's bias.\n\nSo, in Round 1, I have cues A and B. Let's assume that each cue is in a different quadrant. So if I press A, I get information about quadrant A, and pressing B gives me information about quadrant B. Since there are four quadrants in total, but only two cues are active in Round 1, that means two quadrants are active, and the other two are inactive.\n\nBut wait, the problem says that each round, the active cues are chosen, and each quadrant can have at most one cue. So each cue is in a separate quadrant. So if I have four quadrants, and in Round 1, two cues are active, that means two quadrants are active, each with one cue, and the other two quadrants are inactive.\n\nBut the question is, how do I know which quadrant is the biased one? Because the biased quadrant has a 90-10 color distribution, and the others are 50-50. So if I press a cue, I can get a series of samples that indicate the bias of that quadrant.\n\nBut since I only have four rounds, I need to make sure that each round gives me enough information to determine which quadrant is biased. So, in Round 1, I have to choose between A and B. Let's say I choose to press A. Then, based on the samples I get from A, I can determine if A is the biased quadrant or not. But I only have four rounds, so I need to plan which cues to press in each round to maximize the information I get.\n\nWait, but the problem says that after four rounds, I have to identify the biased quadrant. So I need to use the four rounds to gather enough data to determine which quadrant is biased. Each round, I can press one cue, and based on the samples from that cue, I can infer the bias of that quadrant.\n\nBut I have four rounds, so I can press four cues, but since each round only one cue is pressed, and each cue is in a quadrant, I can press up to four cues, each in a different quadrant. But in the first round, only two cues are active, so I can only press one of them. Then in the next rounds, maybe more cues become active.\n\nWait, no. The problem says that in each round, you see active cues (chooseable). So in Round 1, the available cues are A and B. So you can only press one of them. Then, in Round 2, maybe more cues become active, or perhaps the same ones."

Each cue has four quadrants, and each quadrant has a color distribution. One quadrant is biased, meaning it has a 90% chance of one color and a 10% chance of the other. The other three quadrants are 50-50. \n\nRound 1: I chose cue A and saw red. So, after seeing red, I should update my beliefs about which quadrant is biased. Since cue A is active, and it showed red, maybe the red quadrant is the biased one. But I'm not sure yet.\n\nRound 2: Now I have cues A, B, and D available. I need to choose one based on previous observations. Maybe I should choose another cue that was active in Round 1, like B, to see if it also shows red. If both A and B show red, that might reinforce the idea that the red quadrant is biased. If not, maybe the biased quadrant is different.\n\nRound 3: After Round 2, I'll have another cue chosen, say maybe B. If I saw red again, it strengthens the hypothesis. If not, maybe I should try D. \n\nRound 4: Finally, after Round 3, I can make an educated guess based on which cues have shown more reds. If the red quadrant is consistent across the cues I've used, that's probably the biased one.\n\nI think the key is to track how often each quadrant shows red across the cues I've chosen. If one quadrant consistently shows red more often than others, that's likely the biased one. I should probably choose the same cue each time if it keeps showing red, or switch to another if it doesn't. That way, I can gather enough data to make an accurate guess by Round 4."

Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that in each round, only one quadrant is biased with a 90% chance of showing red and a 10% chance of showing another color. The other quadrants have a 50/50 chance of showing red or another color. The goal is to determine which quadrant is the biased one after four rounds, but I only have data from the first three rounds.\n\nLet me summarize the information given:\n\n- **Round 1**: Cues A and B were available. I chose A and saw RED.\n- **Round 2**: Cues A, B, and D were available. I chose A again and saw RED.\n- **Round 3**: Cues B, C, and D were available. I need to choose one of them based on previous observations.\n\nSo, I need to analyze the results from Rounds 1 and 2 to figure out which quadrant is more likely to be biased.\n\nIn Round 1, I chose A and got red. Since the other quadrants (B and C, assuming each quadrant has one color) had a 50% chance, the fact that A came up red once doesn't strongly suggest it's biased. But it's possible.\n\nIn Round 2, I chose A again and got red. Now, this is the second time I chose A and it came up red. This makes me think that maybe A is more likely to be the biased quadrant because I kept choosing it and it kept showing red.\n\nBut wait, what if I had a different strategy? Maybe I should have spread out my choices more. But in this case, I kept choosing A both times it was available.\n\nNow, in Round 3, I have to choose between B, C, or D. Since other cues are B, C, D, and I haven't chosen them yet, maybe I should try a different approach. But how?\n\nI think the key here is to look at the frequency of each quadrant being chosen and the outcomes. So far, A has been chosen twice and came up red both times. B hasn't been chosen yet, but in Round 3, B is an option. C and D also haven't been chosen yet.\n\nBut wait, in Round 1, I had the option to choose A or B. I chose A and got red. In Round 2, I chose A again and got red. So, A has been chosen twice, both times resulting in red. B was not chosen in the first two rounds, so I don't have any data on B.\n\nIn Round 3, I have to choose between B, C, or D. If I choose B, and if B is the biased quadrant, I might get red again, but if it's not, I might get another color. Similarly, if I choose C or D, which were not chosen before, I have no data on them.\n\nBut since A has been chosen twice and both times it was red, it's more likely that A is the biased quadrant. However, I should consider the possibility that it's just a coincidence, but with two reds in a row, it's more probable.\n\nWait, but the problem says that each round, only one quadrant is active. So, in each round, one quadrant is biased, and the others are 50/50. So, if A quadrant is biased, it's 90% chance of red and 10% other color. If another quadrant is biased, it's 50% red.\n\nSo, the more times a quadrant is chosen and it shows red, the more likely it is to be the biased one. Conversely, if a quadrant is chosen and it shows another color, it's more likely that it's not biased there.\n\nIn Round 1: Chose A, got red. If A is biased, that's 90% chance. If not, 50% chance"

The goal is to identify the biased quadrant after four rounds.\n\nLet me go through each round step by step to see if I can spot a pattern or figure out which quadrant is more likely to be biased.\n\nRound 1: Available cues A and B. I chose A and saw RED. Since the quadrant A is in either the first or third quadrant, right? Because each quadrant is 90% one color. So if I got RED, it's more likely that quadrant A is biased towards RED. But I also have to consider that B could be either, but since I didn't choose B, I don't have information about it yet.\n\nRound 2: Available cues A, B, D. I chose A again and saw RED. So this reinforces the idea that A is the biased quadrant. But I also see that B is still available, but I didn't choose it. So B might still be 50/50.\n\nRound 3: Available cues B, C, D. I chose A, but it was an invalid choice. Wait, no, the available cues are B, C, D, but I chose A. So I guess I didn't have A available in this round, so I can't choose it. But I saw that I chose A and it was invalid. Hmm, maybe that means I shouldn't have chosen A in this round, but I did. So perhaps that was a mistake, but since the user says I chose A and saw invalid, maybe A isn't the biased one? But wait, in the first two rounds, I chose A and got RED both times, which would suggest A is biased towards RED.\n\nRound 4: Available cues B and C. I need to choose one based on previous observations. So let's summarize:\n\n- A: Chosen in Round 1 and 2, both times RED. So A seems biased.\n- B: Chosen in Round 2, got RED. But also available in Round 3, but I didn't choose it because A was invalid.\n- C: Available in Round 3 but not chosen in Round 4.\n- D: Not chosen in any round.\n\nBut wait, in Round 3, I was supposed to choose from B, C, D, but I chose A, which was invalid. So maybe that was a mistake, but since the user says I saw invalid choice, perhaps A isn't the biased one. But in the first two rounds, choosing A both times gave RED, which is more likely if A is biased. So maybe I was wrong in Round 3, but I still think A is the biased quadrant.\n\nBut wait, in Round 3, I was supposed to choose from B, C, D, but I chose A, which was invalid. So maybe that was a mistake, and A isn't the biased one. But if A was the biased one, then choosing A in Rounds 1 and 2 would have been correct, and getting RED both times would be more likely if A is biased towards RED.\n\nAlternatively, maybe in Round 3, since I chose A and it was invalid, that suggests that A isn't the correct choice, so perhaps A isn't the biased one. But that contradicts the previous two rounds where choosing A gave RED both times.\n\nThis is confusing. Let me think again.\n\nIf A is the biased quadrant, then choosing A would give RED more often. In Rounds 1 and 2, I chose A and got RED both times, which supports that A is biased towards RED.\n\nIn Round 3, I was supposed to choose from B, C, D, but I chose A, which was invalid.

The active cues disappear after a random time, so I need to make good use of each choice. \n\nRound 1: I chose cue A and saw GREEN. That's a pretty strong indicator. Since the other quadrants have a 50/50 distribution, if A is biased, it's more likely to show green. So I have a 90% chance of green if A is the biased quadrant and 10% if it's not. \n\nRound 2: I chose cue D and saw GREEN again. Now, I'm getting two greens in a row. That's making me think that maybe both A and D are biased, but wait, there's only one biased quadrant. So it's either A or D. Since both gave me green, I need to consider which one is more likely. \n\nRound 3: I have to choose between A, B, or D again. B is the quadrant with the 50/50 distribution, so if I choose B, I might get either color. But since I saw two greens in a row from A and D, I should probably focus on those again. \n\nRound 4: Now, I need to decide which quadrant to choose. I have to make a final decision. Since I saw two greens from A and D, and B is just 50/50, I think the biased quadrant is either A or D. But how do I decide between them? Maybe I should stick with the one that gave me green twice. But I don't know if it's A or D. \n\nWait, maybe I should think about probability. If A is the biased quadrant, the probability of getting green twice is 00 0.9 * 0.9 = 0.81. If D is the biased one, it's 0.9 * 00 0.9 = 0.81. If B is 50/50, getting green twice is 0.5 * 0.5 = 0.25. So, seeing two greens doesn't help much in distinguishing between A and D. \n\nBut I have to make a choice. Since both A and D gave me green, and B is 50/50, I think the biased quadrant is either A or D. But how do I decide between them? Maybe I should choose the one that gave me green more often, but both are the same. Alternatively, maybe I should try to get more data. But since I have only four rounds, and I've already used rounds 1 and 2, I have two rounds left. \n\nWait, in round 3, I could choose between A, B, or D. If I choose B, I might get more data on B, but since B is 50/50, it's not helpful. So maybe I should stick with A or D. But I have to make a choice. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should choose A again in round 3, since it gave me green twice, and see if I get another green. But I don't know if A is the biased one or not. If I choose A again and get green, that would make it three greens in a row, which would make me more confident. But if I get another color, it might suggest that D is the biased one. \n\nBut since I have to make a choice, and I have only four rounds, I think the best approach is to stick with A or D. Since both gave me green, I think the biased quadrant is either A or D. But I have to choose one. Maybe I should choose A again in round 3, and then in round 4, choose A again. But if I choose A and get another green, I can be more confident.

The other quadrants (B, C, D) each have a 50-50 split.

Maybe it means that A isn't the correct choice, so perhaps the other color was shown? Or maybe A is not part of the active cues anymore? But since A was active in both rounds, maybe the Invalid choice means that the other quadrant was selected, but I think the key point is that in Round 2, A was still an option, but the outcome was invalid. Maybe that means that the correct choice wasn't A, so the other color was shown, which would be more likely if A is biased towards GREEN.

So maybe I should choose a different quadrant now. But since A is the only one with a 90% bias, it's still the most probable.\n\nI think I'll go with A again in Round 3 because the bias towards GREEN in A hasn't been contradicted yet. Maybe the invalid choice was just a mistake or something, but the outcomes so far point towards A being the biased quadrant."

          "thinking_tokens": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out which quadrant is biased based on the four rounds of this game. Let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the game has four rounds, and each round presents certain cues. Each cue is in one of the four quadrants. The key point is that in each round, only one quadrant is biased with a 90% chance of one color and 10% the other, while the other three quadrants have a 50/50 distribution. So, the goal is to identify which quadrant is the biased one after four rounds of play.\n\nLet me go through each round and note what happened.\n\nRound 1: Available cues are A. So, only quadrant A is active. You chose A and saw GREEN. Since only quadrant A is active, the 90% chance is for either GREEN or the other color. Since it came up GREEN, that's a strong indication that quadrant A is biased towards GREEN. But let's keep going to see if this holds in the subsequent rounds.\n\nRound 2: Available cues are D. So, only quadrant D is active. You chose A, but wait, quadrant D is active, so why did you choose A? That seems confusing. Or maybe I misunderstood. The available cues are D, meaning only D is active, so you should have chosen D. But you chose A, which is not available. That might be an error in the question or perhaps a mistake in my understanding. Alternatively, maybe the available cues are D, but you chose A, which is not present. Hmm, that's a bit confusing. But assuming that you chose D, you saw something. Wait, the description says you chose A and saw Invalid choice. So, perhaps in Round 2, you chose A, but since only D was available, it was invalid. So maybe the question meant that you tried to choose A, but it was not an available cue. But since the available cues are D, you can't choose A. So maybe that's a mistake. Alternatively, perhaps the available cues are D, but you can choose any of them, but only D is active. This is a bit unclear. Let me assume that in Round 2, the available cues are D, and you chose D, but you saw an invalid choice. Or perhaps you chose A, which was not available, hence invalid. I think the key is that in Round 2, only D was active, so you should have chosen D, but you chose A, which was invalid. So perhaps you made a mistake in selection. But regardless, the important thing is that in Round 2, only D was active, and whatever color you saw, it would indicate that D is biased. But since you saw an invalid choice, maybe that's a red herring or a mistake.\n\nRound 3: Available cues are B, C, D. So, three quadrants are active. You chose A and saw Invalid choice. So, again, you chose A, but it was not among the available cues. So, similar to Round 2, you tried to choose A, which wasn't available. So, perhaps in this round, you saw that A was invalid because it wasn't chosen. But since the available cues were B, C, D, the active quadrant is one of them. So, perhaps in this round, the active quadrant was B, C, or D. But you chose A, which was invalid. So, again, the color you saw might not be relevant because you didn't choose the correct quadrant. Alternatively, perhaps the question means that you tried to choose A, but it was invalid because it wasn't an available cue. So, perhaps in this round, the active quadrant was either B, C, or D, and you saw a color that might indicate their bias, but since you didn't choose them, you saw an invalid choice. I'm a bit confused here.\n\nRound 4: Available cues are A and B. So, two quadrants are active. Based on previous observations, you need to choose"

Each round, one of the quadrants has a 90% chance of showing one color and 10% the other, while the other three quadrants have a 50-50 split. My goal is to identify the biased quadrant after four rounds, and each round I have to choose one cue to activate. \n\nRound 1: I can choose any of the four cues. Since it's the first round, I don't have any previous data, so I might just pick one at random. Let's say I choose cue A. Then, based on what happens, I might get some data about which quadrant is biased.\n\nRound 2: Now, I have one piece of data from Round 1. I need to decide which cue to activate next. Maybe I should try a different one to see if the pattern changes. Let's say I choose cue B this time.\n\nRound 3: With two data points, I can start a pattern. Maybe I should choose another cue to see if the same quadrant is biased or if it's a different one. Let's try cue C.\n\nRound 4: Now I have three data points. I should probably test the last cue, cue D, to see if the pattern holds.\n\nWait, but each round only gives me information about one quadrant, right? Because each cue activates one quadrant. So each time I choose a cue, I'm getting data about which quadrant it corresponds to. So, if I choose A, B, C, D in order, I can track the color distribution for each each quadrant across the four rounds.\n\nBut the problem is, I don't know which cue corresponds to which quadrant. The user just says \"Available cues A, B, C, D\" each time, but I don't know which is which. Hmm, that complicates things because I might not know which data points correspond to which quadrants.\n\n Wait, no, actually, each cue is associated with one quadrant. So when I activate a cue, it's linked to a specific quadrant. So if I activate cue A, it's always the same quadrant. So over four rounds, activating four different cues would give me data about all four quadrants. But since I have four cues, but only four quadrants, maybe I can map them.\n\nBut the user just says \"Available cues A. Based on previous observations, choose one cue by responding with just the letter. You press <<\". Wait, no, in the initial prompt, it says \"Available cues A. Based on previous observations, choose one cue by responding with just the letter. You press <<\". That seems like a typo, maybe it's supposed to be A, B, C, D. \n\nAssuming that each cue corresponds to a different quadrant, and each time I activate a cue, I get data about that specific quadrant's color distribution. So over four rounds, activating each cue once would give me data about all four quadrants. But the user is asking me to choose one cue each round, so I have to choose which quadrant to observe each round.\n\nWait, but if I choose a cue each round, and each cue corresponds to a quadrant, then over four rounds, I can choose each cue once, and thus observe each quadrant once. But since the user is asking me to choose one cue each round, I can spread out my choices to cover all quadrants.\n\nBut the problem is, in each round, only one quadrant is biased. So each round, only one of the four quadrants has a 90% chance of one color, and the others have 50-50. So, if I choose a cue that's associated with the biased quadrant, I'll see a higher probability of one color. If I choose a cue for an unbiased quadrant, I'll see roughly 50-50.\n\nSo, over four rounds, if I activate each cue once, I can track the color distribution for each quadrant.

There are four rounds, and in each round, I get to choose which quadrant's cues to look at. Each quadrant has a 90% chance of being one color and a 10% chance of the other, but the other three quadrants have a 50-50 chance each. The active cues disappear after a random time, so I have to rely on the information from each round to figure out which quadrant is more likely to be biased.\n\nRound 1: I chose cue A and saw green. That's a pretty strong indication that quadrant A might be the biased one, but I shouldn't jump to conclusions yet. Maybe it's just a coincidence. But since it's one data point, it's pointing towards A being the biased quadrant.\n\nRound 2: Now I have to choose between cues B and C. I need to decide which one to pick next. Since I saw green in A, maybe B or C is also biased, but I don't have any data yet. I should probably choose one of them to see if I get another green. Let's say I choose B and see green again. That strengthens the idea that B might be biased too, but I still need to confirm.\n\nRound 3: I have to choose between the remaining cues. If I chose B in Round 2 and saw green, then in Round 3, I might pick C. If I see green again, that would make me more confident that C is biased. But if I don't see green, it might mean that B was the biased one, or maybe C is biased towards the other color. I need to make sure I'm spreading my choices to cover all possibilities.\n\nRound 4: Now I have only one cue left, which should be the last remaining one. If I've been consistent with my choices, the last quadrant should be the one with the higher probability of being biased. But I also need to be careful because each round's result is random, so it's possible that I might get a green or a non-green even if the quadrant isn't biased.\n\nWait, but in Round 1, I saw green. If the quadrant is biased towards green, that makes sense. If it's not, then it's just a 10% chance. So after four rounds, each with a possible green or not, I can tally up how many greens each quadrant has. The quadrant with the most greens is probably the biased one.\n\nBut I have to remember that each round's result is independent, so it's not a direct count. However, over four rounds, if one quadrant is truly biased, it's more likely to show green more often. So by the end, the quadrant with the most greens is the biased one.\n\nI think I should go with the quadrant that has the most greens across all four rounds as the biased quadrant. That makes sense because the biased quadrant has a higher chance of showing green each time I look at it."

The active cues disappear after a random time, so I don't know how long they'll be up. The goal is to identify the biased quadrant after four rounds, and I get points based on whether I'm right or wrong.\n\nFirst, let me understand the setup. There are four quadrants, and each quadrant has a color distribution. One quadrant is biased: it has a 90% chance of one color and 10% of the other. The other three quadrants have a 50-50% distribution. So, the task is to determine which quadrant is the biased one based on the outcomes of four rounds.\n\nEach round, I can choose one active cue, and depending on which quadrant it's from, I might see a color. If the cue is from the biased quadrant, I have a higher chance of seeing that color, but if it's from an unbiased quadrant, I see either color with equal probability.\n\nLet me go through each round step by step.\n\nRound 1: Available cues are A. I chose A and saw GREEN. So, in this case, if A is the biased quadrant, then GREEN is more likely. But if A is unbiased, then GREEN is just a 50% chance. Since I saw GREEN, it's possible that A is biased towards GREEN, but I can't be certain yet.\n\nRound 2: Available cues are B. I chose B and saw an invalid choice. Hmm, what does an invalid choice mean? Maybe it means that the color I saw wasn't possible for that quadrant. If B is the biased quadrant, then depending on which color it's biased towards, I might have seen that color more often, but since I saw an invalid choice, perhaps B is the biased quadrant towards a color that wasn't shown. Or maybe it's a mistake in the game. But I'm not sure. Let me think: if B was the biased quadrant, and it's biased towards, say, GREEN, then I would have seen GREEN more often. But here, I saw an invalid choice, which might mean that B is actually biased towards a different different color that wasn't shown, or maybe the quadrant was supposed to show one color but didn't. Alternatively, maybe the invalid choice is a result of the quadrant being the biased one towards a color that wasn't observed. I'm a bit confused here. Maybe I should consider that B could be the biased quadrant because I saw an invalid choice, which might indicate that it's less likely to show a valid color, but I'm not sure.\n\nRound 3: Available cues are A, C, D. I need to choose one. Based on previous observations: from Round 1, I saw GREEN with A. From Round 2, I saw an invalid choice with B. So, if A was in Round 1 and I saw GREEN, maybe A is the biased quadrant towards GREEN. But in Round 2, B was chosen and an invalid choice was made, which might suggest that B is the biased quadrant towards a different color, but I saw an invalid choice, which is confusing. Alternatively, maybe B is the correct answer because it's the only quadrant that was chosen and didn't show a valid color, but I'm not sure.\n\nWait, maybe I should think about the probabilities. Each round, the active cues are chosen, and depending on which quadrant they're from, the color is more or less likely. So, if A was chosen and GREEN was seen, that's consistent with A being the biased quadrant towards GREEN. If B was chosen and an invalid choice was made, maybe B is the biased quadrant towards a different color, but since I saw an invalid choice, perhaps that's a different scenario. Alternatively, maybe the invalid choice is a result of the quadrant being the biased one towards a color that wasn't shown, but I'm not sure.\n\nWait, maybe the invalid choice is a result of the"

Let me go through each round step by step and see what information I can gather.\n\nRound 1: The only available cue is A, and I chose it. I saw GREEN. Since there's only one cue, this is my first data point. If A is the biased quadrant, it should have a higher chance of showing green, which it did here. But I can't be sure yet because it's just one observation.\n\nRound 2: The available cues are B. But I chose C, which I didn't see. Hmm, that's confusing. The description says I chose C and saw an invalid choice. Wait, maybe I misread. It says I chose C, but C wasn't available in Round 2. So that must mean that in Round 2, the available cues were B, but I incorrectly chose C. So I saw an invalid choice, which might mean that C wasn't an option, so I can't get any information from this round because I didn't actually choose B. So Round 2 doesn't give me any useful data.\n\nRound 3: Available cues are A, C, D. I chose A and saw RED. So now I have two observations: A showed GREEN in Round 1 and RED in Round 3. If A is the biased quadrant, it should mostly show green, but here it showed red once. That's a bit contradictory. Maybe it's random, but it's possible that A is the biased quadrant but just had a bad run.\n\nRound 4: Available cues are B and C. I need to choose one. Based on previous observations, I should consider which cues have been more consistent with their colors. From Round 1, A was green. Round 3, A was red. So A seems to be switching, which might not be reliable. Since B was only available in Round 2, which I didn't actually choose, I have no direct data on B. However, in Round 3, when A was chosen, it was red, but maybe the other cues C and D are less likely to be biased because they weren't chosen often. So, if I have to choose between B and C, and I don't have data on B, maybe I should look at what C did in Round 3. C wasn't chosen, but when it was available in Round 3, was it chosen? Wait, no, in Round 3, I chose A. So I don't know what C did in Round 3. Maybe I should consider that C wasn't chosen, so I don't have any data on its color distribution.\n\nWait, but in Round 2, I tried to choose C, but it was invalid. So C wasn't an option there. So, maybe C is another quadrant that isn't biased, but I don't have data on it. So, considering that, I have only two data points: A showed green once and red once. So, A is 50-50, which doesn't make it biased. That leaves me with B and C. Since B wasn't chosen at all, and C was chosen once in Round 3 but saw red. Hmm, but in Round 3, I chose A and saw red, so C wasn't chosen there. So, maybe C is 50-50 as well. So, I'm confused.\n\nWait, but in the first round, A was green. If A is 90% green, that would be a strong bias. But in Round 3, it was red. Maybe it's just a random variation. So, maybe A is still biased towards green, but had a bad run. So, in Round 4, I have to choose between B and C. Since B wasn't chosen, I don don't have any data on it. C was chosen once, but in that case, I saw red. But since it's a 50-50 quadrant, maybe"
