The active cues are A, B, C in the first round. Each quadrant has a 90% chance of being one color and 10% the other, but the other three quadrants have a 50-50 split. The active cues disappear after a random time, so I don't know how many are active each round, but at least one is always active.\n\nMy goal is to identify the biased quadrant after four rounds, and I get points based on whether I'm right or wrong. So, I need to figure out a strategy to maximize my chances of getting the correct answer.\n\nFirst, I think I need to understand how the cues work. Each cue (A, B, C) corresponds to one quadrant. So, if a cue is active, it's pointing to its respective quadrant. Since each quadrant has a 90% chance of being biased, the more times a cue is active, the higher the probability that its corresponding quadrant is the biased one.\n\nBut wait, the problem says that in each round, the active cues are chosen, and each active cue corresponds to a quadrant. So, in round 1, the available cues are A, b, and C. So, each of these cues points to a different quadrant. So, if"

My job is to figure out which quadrant is the biased one after four rounds, and I get points based on whether I'm right or wrong.\n\nRound 1: I had cues A, B, and C. I chose A and saw RED. So, from this, I can infer that if A is the biased quadrant, then RED is more likely. But I don't know yet, so I need to keep track.\n\nRound 2: Now I have cues C and D. I need to choose one. Since I saw A was red in the first round, maybe C is still a candidate. But now I have two only C and D. I think I should probably choose C again to see if it's the biased one. If I press C and it's red again, that might support that C is biased. If not, maybe D is biased.\n\nRound 3: The available cues are D, E, F. So now I have three options.

Let me go through each round step by step and see if I can make sense of it.\n\nRound 1: The available cues are A, B, and C. I chose A and saw red. From the rules, each round, one quadrant has 90% of one color and 10% of the other, while the other quadrants have a 50/50 distribution. So, if I chose A and saw red, it's more likely that quadrant A is the biased one because 90% chance of red is higher than 50%. But I can't be certain yet because it's just one observation.\n\nRound 2: The available cues are C and D. I chose C and saw red again. Now, if C is the same quadrant as in Round 1, this reinforces the idea that C might be the biased quadrant. But wait, in Round 1, I chose A, so C was another quadrant. Now, in Round 2, choosing C and getting red again suggests that C might also be biased towards red. However, in Round 1, A was biased, so C could be either biased or not. But since in Round 2, C was chosen and red came up, it's more likely that C is biased too.\n\nRound 3: The available cues are A"

But since in Round 2, I only had C and D, and C was red again, maybe C is more likely to be the biased one.\n\nRound 3: Available cues were A and B. I chose A and saw green this time.
