Starting 1 simulations
Rounds per simulation: 2
Number of quadrants: 3


=== Simulation 1 ===
Correct quadrant: 2
LLM choice: <<<<<<<<< the following.
Quadrant1: 99% red. Quadrant2: 95% red. Quadrant3: 90% red.

Wait, I think the problem is:

You have two rounds.

In each round, there are three quadrants: one with 90% color (let's say red) and 10% other (blue), and two with 50% each color.

The active cue is one quadrant, chosen uniformly at random in each round.

In each round, 80% of the active cue is inactive, and the rest is active, so in round 1, active cue is 90% red, so 10% is
Success: False

INITIAL_DESCRIPTION:
----------------------------------------
You will play a game with 2 rounds.
In each round you'll see active cues (chooseable):
One quadrant has 90% one color/10% other
Other quadrants have 50/50 color distribution
At least one cue active per round
Active cues disappear after random duration

After 2 rounds, identify the biased quadrant.
Correct: +100 points, Wrong: -100 points.

You will play a game with 2 rounds.
In each round you'll see active cues (chooseable):
One quadrant has 90% one color/10% other

At least one cue active per round
Active cues disappear after random duration

After 2 rounds, identify the biased quadrant.
Correct: +100 points, Wrong: -100 points.

Round 1: Available cues A, C. Based on previous observations, choose one cue by responding with just the letter. You press <<

LLM_CHOICE:
----------------------------------------
A >> and so on. In round 1, the active cue is the color with 90% chance. The initial active cue is 90% color.

In round 2, active cue has 50% color with 95% chance. Active cue is 50% color.

In round 2, active cue has 50% color with 90% chance. Active cue is 50% color.

So after round 1, the active cues is active with color 99% and 100%... So in round 2, active cue is 5% color with 95% chance.

But according to previous observations, after a few rounds of round

Round 1: Available cues A, C. You chose A >> and so on. In round 1, the active cue is the color with 90% chance. The initial active cue is 90% color.

In round 2, active cue has 50% color with 95% chance. Active cue is 50% color.

In round 2, active cue has 50% color with 90% chance. Active cue is 50% color.

So after round 1, the active cues is active with color 99% and 100%... So in round 2, active cue is 5% color with 95% chance.

But according to previous observations, after a few rounds of round and saw Invalid choice.
Round 2: Available cues A, B, C. Based on previous observations, choose one cue by responding with just the letter. You press <<

LLM_CHOICE:
----------------------------------------
A>> and <<B>> and <<C>>. So after two rounds, invalid choice.

But in round 1, you chose A and it was a color with 90% chance. But active cue is 90% so no active cue is deleted.

Wait, the confusion is that during round 1, the active cue is 90% chance. So 10% inactive.

Then in round 2, after inactive cue is deleted, but there are more cues. Hmm. So maybe in each round, the active cue is chosen, which has 90% chance, then the inactive cue is deleted, but active cues could disappear. But after each round, the total pool is 90% active

RESULT:

Based on all observed colors, which quadrant (1, 2, 3) do you think had the highest ratio of RED? Respond with just the number. You choose <<
