Starting 1 simulations
Rounds per simulation: 2
Number of quadrants: 3


=== Simulation 1 ===
Correct quadrant: 2
LLM choice: ... >> where the number corresponds to the quadrant (1, 2, or 3). The number is correct, which leads to a gain of +100 points.

Wait, the question is about Round 1.

The original question is about the game where you play two rounds. Each round has active cues. You can choose a cue which is then used to get feedback on the response letters. The correct quadrant has the highest ratio of RED.

Round 1: I chose..., which
Success: False

INITIAL_DESCRIPTION:
----------------------------------------
You will play a game with 2 rounds.
In each round you'll see active cues (chooseable):
One quadrant has 90% one color/10% other
Other quadrants have 50/50 color distribution
At least one cue active per round
Active cues disappear after random duration

After 2 rounds, identify the biased quadrant.
Correct: +100 points, Wrong: -100 points.

After 2 rounds, identify the biased quadrant.
Correct: +100 points, Wrong: -100 points.

Round 1: Available cues A, C. Based on previous observations, choose one cue by responding with just the letter. You press <<

LLM_CHOICE:

...>> with the letter. Then press shift <<...>> with the shift. The response will get the letters for the active cues A and C. For the active cues, the response will get the letters for A and C.

Wait, I'm a bit confused about this. Let me try to break it down.

In each round, you have two active cues: one quadrant has 90% of one color and 10% the other; the other quadrants have equal parts.

RESULT:
----------------------------------------
Invalid choice

Round 2: Available cues A, B, C. Based on previous observations, choose one cue by responding with just the letter. You press <<

LLM_CHOICE:
----------------------------------------
...>> which will update the response based on the active cues.

So, during Round 1, you have:

Active quadrants: A and C, because their response letters (e.g., A and C) were used.

But you chose...>> with the letter A, and then pressed shift <<...>> with the shift. Then the response received letters A and C. After that, you noticed that you choose the cue.

So in Round 2, active quadrants are A, B

Based on all observed colors, which quadrant (1, 2, 3) do you think had the highest ratio of RED? Respond with just the number. You choose <<
