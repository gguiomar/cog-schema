Other quadrants have 50/50 color distribution
At least one cue active per round
Active cues disappear after random duration

After 4 rounds, identify the biased quadrant.
Correct: +100 points, Wrong: -100 points.

Round 1: Available cues A. You chose  and saw Invalid choice.
Round 2: Available cues A, B. You chose B and saw RED.
Round 3: Available cues A. You chose A and saw RED.
Round 4: Available cues A. You chose >> and saw Invalid choice.
Based on all observed colors, which quadrant (1, 2) do you think had the highest ratio of RED? Respond with just the number. You choose <<
