Starting 1 simulations
Rounds per simulation: 2
Number of quadrants: 3


=== Simulation 1 ===
Correct quadrant: 2
LLM choice: start>> in round 1, and <<start>> in round2.

Wait, maybe the problem is that in each round, you can choose one cue to select a quadrant. The chosen quadrant will lose its active cue after some time. All cues in the game have the same duration. Cues in type 1 have varying durations based on the number of active cues.

In round 1, available cues are A, B, C. chosen to begin with start>>. So you select a cue in round1.

Wait, maybe the rules are that you choose a cue each round, and that cue will become active and last for a certain duration. The total game ends after two rounds, and the quadrant with the highest ratio is identified.
Success: False

INITIAL_DESCRIPTION:
----------------------------------------
You will play a game with 2 rounds.
In each round you'll see active cues (chooseable):
One quadrant has 90% one color/10% other
Other quadrants have 50/50 color distribution
At least one cue active per round
Active cues disappear after random duration

After 2 rounds, identify the biased quadrant.
Correct: +100 points, Wrong: -100 points.

To understand the problem, the following description applies. The active cues in the game have two types:

Type 1: 90% one color, 10% other.
Type 2: 50% each color.

Each cue has a duration of 1 to 100.

All cues in the game have the same duration.

Cues in type 1 have varying durations based on the number of active cues.
If two or more active cues are active, the durations of

Wait, this seems a bit confusing. Let me try to break it down.

In each round, I have 3 available cues (A, B, C for round 1, A, B, C for round 2). I can choose one cue per round to select the quadrant. Once I choose a cue, the cues become active, and after a random duration, they disappear. The same goes for if I press start again in round 2.

Wait, maybe it's better to model each round as the same structure. Let me re-read the problem.

The problem describes a game with two rounds. Each round, there are three available cues (A, B, C). You choose one by selecting the
