Rounds per simulation: 2
Number of quadrants: 3


=== Simulation 1 ===
Correct quadrant: 3
LLM choice: number. You choose <<button>> again if needed until the cue is active.

So, in Round 1, you choose a letter, say A. You then press again with another letter (maybe B) until it becomes active. But in each Round, if you choose A, and it becomes active, you can just press A again to stay active. Or maybe you have to keep pressing until it is active.

Wait, perhaps in each round, each quadrant (A, B, C) is active, and each has certain color proportions. So in each round, each of the quadrants can have a different color distribution. But per problem statement, in each round, the active quadrants show one quadrant with 90% color and 10% another, and the others have 50/50. But wait, the initial part says: each round you'll see active cues A, B, C. The other quadrants have 50% colors. Each round you'll have active cues A, B, C, or maybe D? Let me re-read.

Wait, the problem statement for each round says:

"In each round you'll see active cues A, B, C. Depending on one quadrant, either 90% one color and 10
Success: False

INITIAL_DESCRIPTION:
----------------------------------------
You will play a game with 2 rounds.
In each round you'll see active cues (chooseable):
One quadrant has 90% one color/10% other
Other quadrants have 50/50 color distribution
At least one cue active per round
Active cues disappear after random duration

After 2 rounds, identify the biased quadrant.
Correct: +100 points, Wrong: -100 points.

Round 2: Available cues A, B, C, D. Based on previous observations, choose one cue by pressing the letter again. You press <<button>> again with another letter if needed, until the cue is active.

The active cues disappear after random duration.

Note:  you have to choose only one.

To explain your approach, let's try to model the system.

Model the game after 2 rounds.

In each round, the active cues A, B, C, or D (depending on the round), and for each, have 90% color one, 10% another, or maybe something else.

Wait, let me recheck.

The problem statement says: each round, the active cues A, B, C, or D (depending on the round) have one quadrant with 90% one color and 10% another.

Hmm, perhaps in each round, each quadrant has a certain proportion of colors. So, for example, in a given round, one of the active quadrants (quadrants are labeled A, B, C, D in each round?) has 90% one color and 10% other.

But wait, the problem says each round you see active cues A, B, C. In Round 1 you choose a letter (A, B, C, or D?), wait, perhaps in each round you have the cues A, B, C (if it's the first), in Round 2 it's A, B, C, D.

Hmm, perhaps each quadrant in each round has a particular state.

Alternatively, perhaps in each round, the active quadrants are one of the four, and for each such active quadrant, that quadrant has 90% color in one color, 10% another. The others (the non-active quadrants) are in a 50/50 state. Or, perhaps each round, exactly one of the quadrants is active, each such quadrant's state is 90% one color, 10
