Starting 1 simulations
Rounds per simulation: 2
Number of quadrants: 2


=== Simulation 1 ===
Correct quadrant: 1
LLM choice: B>>.

Wait, that's not correct. The correct answer is to respond with the number of RED.

Wait, no: the correct answer is to respond with the number of RED. But the problem is that each round, you can choose any cue, and the chosen cue's color is added to the analysis. So based on the available cues in each round and the color information you have, you select which cue to choose to maximize the RED count after all rounds.

But each cue in each round is a quadrant with 90% one color and 10% the other color. The other quadrants are 50-50. The active quadrants at each round.

Hmm, I'm a bit confused about the setup
Success: False

INITIAL_DESCRIPTION:
----------------------------------------
You will play a game with 2 rounds.
In each round you'll see active cues (chooseable):
One quadrant has 90% one color/10% other
Other quadrants have 50/50 color distribution
At least one cue active per round
Active cues disappear after random duration

After 2 rounds, identify the biased quadrant.
Correct: +100 points, Wrong: -100 points.

B>> or <<C>>.

In round 1, you have the cue B.

Round 2: Available cues C. Based on previous observations, choose one cue by responding with just the letter. You press <<C>> or <<D>>.

Round 2: Available cues D. Based on previous observations, choose one cue by responding with just the letter. You press <<D>> or <<E>>.

Round 1 and Round 2: Each round, you'll see the active cues. You can choose one cue each round.

In each round, you can choose one cue from the active cues.

You can choose any cue in any round, but once chosen, the cue disappears after the random
duration of that period, which
