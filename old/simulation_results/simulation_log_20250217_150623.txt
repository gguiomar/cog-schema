Correct quadrant: 2
LLM choice: Okay, so I'm trying to solve this game described by the user. Let me break it down step by step.

First, the game consists of two rounds. In each round, there are active cues arranged on a grid. The cues are colored either red or another color, and the distribution is specific. In each round, at least one cue is active, and after a random duration, it disappears.

The user chose "Alright" and "I just saw the user's query" in the

INITIAL_DESCRIPTION:
----------------------------------------
You will play a game with 2 rounds.
In each round you'll see active cues (chooseable):
One quadrant has 90% one color/10% other
Other quadrants have 50/50 color distribution
At least one cue active per round
Active cues disappear after random duration

After 2 rounds, identify the biased quadrant.
Correct: +100 points, Wrong: -100 points.

Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, the user provided a query about a game with specific rules and wants me to think through how to approach it. The game is divided into two rounds, each involving active cues on a grid. Each round has certain rules about cue distribution and how they behave. My task is to figure out how to respond to this query effectively.

First, I need to understand the structure of the game. In each round, there are active cues. The

Okay, I just saw the user's query. They provided a game description with specific rules and asked me to respond. The user wants me to think through how to approach solving it. They might be interested in game strategy or possibly trying to solve the game themselves. I should provide a clear, step-by-step explanation based on the rules they mentioned.
