Starting 1 simulations
Rounds per simulation: 2
Number of quadrants: 2


=== Simulation 1 ===
Correct quadrant: 1
LLM choice: 1>>, <<2>>.

Wait, maybe it's simpler: Each quadrant is either active or inactive. The active quadrant has 90% and 10%. The other is 50 and 50.

Each round you have two quadrants: 1 is active, 2 is inactive. The active quadrant is either 90% red or 10% red, the other is 50-50.

When you choose a cue (either quadrant or letter), you get feedback whether it's correct or not. For example, in Round 1, it says after seeing Invalid choice.

Wait, maybe it's round 1: available cues B, you choose B and get an incorrect response.

So the
Success: False

INITIAL_DESCRIPTION:
----------------------------------------
You will play a game with 2 rounds.
In each round you'll see active cues (chooseable):
One quadrant has 90% one color/10% other
Other quadrants have 50/50 color distribution
At least one cue active per round
Active cues disappear after random duration

After 2 rounds, identify the biased quadrant.
Correct: +100 points, Wrong: -100 points.

Round 1: Available cues B. Based on previous observations, choose one cue by responding with just the letter. You press <<

B>> and the AI will respond with either <<up>> or <<down>> or <<left>> or <<right>>, or <<correct>> or <<wrong>>.

Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let's try to figure it out step by step.

First, in each round of the game, you are presented with two quadrants: one is fully active, the other is inactive. The active quadrant has two colors, with 90% and 10% of the active cells being the other color. Wait, no, one quadrant is 90% and 10% and the other is 50/50.

So, in Round 1, after seeing the active cues B, the AI is supposed

letter>> with just the letter. Hmm, that might be indicating that the AI can only choose one cue and is acting based on the information from the previous round.

Wait, maybe it's simpler: in each round, you are given two cues, one is active, one is inactive. The active one is a quadrant with two colors, 90% one and 10% the other. The other quadrant is 50% and 50%. Active cues disappear after some time, which depends on the state of that cue. But each round starts with 50% active per quadrant, but with one quadrant having an active cue that is either 90% one color or 10% the other.

So,

So, and saw Invalid choice.
Based on all observed colors, which quadrant (1, 2) do you think had the highest ratio of RED? Respond with just the number. You choose <<
