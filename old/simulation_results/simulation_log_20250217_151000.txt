=== Simulation 1 ===
Correct quadrant: 2
LLM choice: Okay, so I'm trying to figure out which quadrant had the highest ratio of RED based on the user's responses and the game rules. Let me break this down step by step.

First, the user played two rounds of the game, each round having two active cues, A and B. In each round, one quadrant has 90% one color and 10% the other, and the other quadrants are 50/50. The user's responses are important,
Success: False

INITIAL_DESCRIPTION:
----------------------------------------
You will play a game with 2 rounds.
In each round you'll see active cues (chooseable):
One quadrant has 90% one color/10% other
Other quadrants have 50/50 color distribution
At least one cue active per round
Active cues disappear after random duration

After 2 rounds, identify the biased quadrant.
Correct: +100 points, Wrong: -100 points.

You will play a game with 2 rounds.
In each round you'll see active cues (chooseable):
One quadrant has 90% one color/10% other
Other quadrants have 50/50 color distribution
At least one cue active per round
Active cues disappear after random duration

After 2 rounds, identify the biased quadrant.
Correct: +100 points, Wrong: -100 points.

Round 1: Available cues A, B. Based on previous observations, choose one cue by responding with just the letter. You press <think>

Alright, let's break down the user's query. They've provided a game scenario with two rounds and specific rules. The user has asked to play through it, but the instructions are a bit tricky. Let me see what they want.

First, in each round, there are active cues. One quadrant has 90% one color and 10% the other. The others are 50/50. At least one cue is active per round, and they disappear after a

First, in each round, there are active cues. One quadrant has 90% one color and 10% the other. The others are 50/50. At least one cue is active per round, and they disappear after a and saw Invalid choice.
Round 2: Available cues A, B. Based on previous observations, choose one cue by responding with just the letter. You press <think>

LLM_CHOICE:
----------------------------------------
Okay, I just saw the user's query. They provided a game scenario with two rounds and some specific rules. Let me parse this out.

So, in each round, there are active cues. One quadrant has 90% one color and 10% the other. The other quadrants are 50/50. At least one cue is active per round, and they disappear after a random duration.

After two rounds, I need to identify the biased quadrant. Correct gives
