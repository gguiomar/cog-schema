=== Simulation 1 ===
Correct quadrant: 2
LLM choice: button>> in Round 1. Then, in Round2, you can see the colors, and choose the next cue.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating.

Wait, each round, you have active cues (each quadrant). You choose one to press.

The active cues have different color distributions.

If a cue is selected and you choose Invalid:

The number of colors observed (say 90% RED, 10% other).

Once you choose to press, in round two, you can see the colors.

Based on this, you have to choose which quadrant is biased.

But the problem is about two rounds, each with active cues.

In each round, there's one active cue in one of the quadrants. You
Success: False

INITIAL_DESCRIPTION:
----------------------------------------
You will play a game with 2 rounds.
In each round you'll see active cues (chooseable):
One quadrant has 90% one color/10% other
Other quadrants have 50/50 color distribution
At least one cue active per round
Active cues disappear after random duration

After 2 rounds, identify the biased quadrant.
Correct: +100 points, Wrong: -100 points.

Round 1: Available cues A, B, C. Based on previous observations, choose one cue by responding with just the letter. You press <<

LLM_CHOICE:

button>> once.

In each round, the active cues are shown, and they will be chosen: you can choose any active cue.

Round 2: Available cues A, B, C. Same setup as Round 1.

After 2 rounds, identify the biased quadrant.

Let me explain the problem. In the round 1, when active cues are given, you can choose any cue, which will be shown again in round 2.

You can press <<button>> in Round 1 to choose cue A, B, or C.

After choosing Round 1 cue, in Round 2, you can press <<button>> again to choose cue A, B, or C.

Each cue will show the active cues, then choose one

After choosing Round 1 cue, in Round 2, you can press <<button>> again to choose cue A, B, or C.

Each cue will show the active cues, then choose one and saw Invalid choice.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me parse the problem statement again.

In Round 1, you have active cues, which are one quadrant. Each cue (A, B, C) has certain color distributions: one has 90% and 10% other, others have 50/50.

At least one cue active per round.

After 2 rounds, you need to identify the biased quadrant.

Hmm. Now in each round, active cues will disappear after random duration.

Wait, perhaps in each round, you can see the active cues and choose one to press. The active cues disappear after a certain duration.

But more importantly, in each round, the active cues
