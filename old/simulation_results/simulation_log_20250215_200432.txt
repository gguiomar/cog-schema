Rounds per simulation: 2
Number of quadrants: 2


=== Simulation 1 ===
Correct quadrant: 2
LLM choice: number. You choose <<Red>>.
</think>

**Step 1:** Analyze Previous Observations

- **Quadrant 1:** 90% color, 10% other color
- **Quadrant2:** 50% color

- **Previous Observations:** B's color distribution matches other quadrants.

- **Probability Analysis:**
  - Correct Choice (A): 90% chance
  - Incorrect Choice (B): 10% chance

- **Observation:** B has a color distribution that matches other quadrants.

**Step 2:** Identify the Correct Choice

- Based on previous observations, the correct cue is quadrant **A**.

**Final Answer:**

A<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>
Success: False

INITIAL_DESCRIPTION:
----------------------------------------
You will play a game with 2 rounds.
In each round you'll see active cues (chooseable):
One quadrant has 90% one color/10% other
Other quadrants have 50/50 color distribution
At least one cue active per round
Active cues disappear after random duration

After 2 rounds, identify the biased quadrant.
Correct: +100 points, Wrong: -100 points.
