INITIAL_DESCRIPTION:
----------------------------------------
You will play a game with 2 rounds.
In each round you'll see active cues (chooseable):
One quadrant has 90% one color/10% other
Other quadrants have 50/50 color distribution
At least one cue active per round
Active cues disappear after random duration

After 2 rounds, identify the biased quadrant.
Correct: +100 points, Wrong: -100 points.

### **Round 1:**

**Available Cues:** A (active)

- **Cue A:** It is active in round 1.
- **Initial Setup:** The game has two quadrants with different color distributions:
  - One quadrant has 90% one color and 10% the other.
  - Other quadrants have 50% and 50% color distribution.
- **Active Cues Disappear:** After random removal duration.
- **Points System:**
  - Correct: +100 points.
  - Wrong: -100 points.

**Round 1 Observations:**
- **Q1. How is the game structured?**  
  - **Cue A (active):** It has a 90% color concentration and 10% another color.

**Round 1 Analysis:**
- **Round 1: Active Cues - A**
