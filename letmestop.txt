<｜User｜>How many r's are in Strawberry? Answer using a single token<｜Assistant｜><think>
I need to determine how many times the letter 'r' appears in the word "strawberry." 

First, I'll write out the word "strawberry" and count each 'r' individually. 

The word is: s t r a w b r e t t y

I'll go through each letter and note the 'r's. 

- The first letter is 's' (no).
- The second is 't' (no).
- The third is 'r' (count = 1).
- The fourth is 'a' (no).
- The fifth is 'w' (no).
- The sixth is 'b' (no).
- The seventh is 'r' (count = 2).
- The eighth is 'e' (no).
- The ninth is 't' (no).
- The tenth is 't' (no).
- The eleventh is 'y' (no).

After counting, there are two 'r's in the word "strawberry."
