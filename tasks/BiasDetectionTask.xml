Task:
You will play a game with {n_rounds} rounds.
In each round you'll see available cues (choosable):
One cue has 90% one color / 10% other, others have 50/50 color distribution.
Possible cues are: A, B, C, D.
Active cues disappear after random duration, at least one cue is active per round.
Your task is to pick one of the available cues every round, by responding with just the letter and nothing else. Don't use markup or punctuation.
After {n_rounds} rounds, identify the biased cue.
Correct: +100 points, Wrong: -100 points.

Task: Bias Detection Game

You will play a game to identify a randomly-sampled biased cue among four options.
You will play {n_rounds} rounds to identify which cue shows one outcome more frequently than the other .

Game Rules:
- 4 possible cues: A, B, C, D
- ONE cue shows a particular outcome 90% of the time (the "biased" cue)
- ALL other cues show both outcomes equally (50/50)
- Each round, you see which cues are available and choose one
- Available cues change randomly between rounds
- You must choose from available options only

After {n_rounds} rounds, you'll identify the biased cue.
Scoring: Correct = +100 points, Wrong = -100 points
</initial_prompt>

<intermediate_prompt>
Trial {current_trial}, Round {current_round}/{n_rounds}
Available cues: {available_cues}

Choose ONE letter from the available options above.
Response format: Single letter only (A, B, C, or D)
</intermediate_prompt>

<feedback_prompt>
Trial {current_trial}, Round {current_round}/{n_rounds}
Available: {available_cues} | You chose: {current_answer} | Result: {result_text}

Progress: {current_round} rounds completed

</feedback_prompt>

<final_prompt>
Trial {current_trial} - FINAL DECISION

Review your observations across all {n_rounds} rounds.
Which cue ({letters}) showed its dominant outcome most frequently?

The biased cue shows one outcome 90% of the time.
Unbiased cues show each outcome only 50% of the time.

Your answer (one letter):
