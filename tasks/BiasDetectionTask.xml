Task:
You will play a game with {n_rounds} rounds.
In each round you'll see available cues (choosable):
One cue has 90% one color / 10% other, others have 50/50 color distribution.
Possible cues are: A, B, C, D.
Active cues disappear after random duration, at least one cue is active per round.
Your task is to pick one of the available cues every round, by responding with just the letter and nothing else. Don't use markup or punctuation.
After {n_rounds} rounds, identify the biased cue.
Correct: +100 points, Wrong: -100 points.

Task: Bayesian Bias Detection

BAYESIAN FRAMEWORK:
- Prior: Each cue has 25% chance of being biased (uniform prior)
- Evidence: Observe RED/GREEN outcomes through {n_rounds} rounds
- Posterior: Update beliefs about which cue is biased

LIKELIHOOD MODEL:
- If cue is biased: P(RED) = 0.9, P(GREEN) = 0.1
- If cue is unbiased: P(RED) = 0.5, P(GREEN) = 0.5
- Exactly 1 cue is biased (randomly selected, consistent per trial)

INFERENCE PROCESS:
1. Evidence Accumulation: {n_rounds} rounds of observations
2. Posterior Calculation: Update beliefs after each observation
3. Maximum A Posteriori: Select cue with highest posterior probability

Your goal: Use Bayesian reasoning to identify which cue has the 90/10 bias.
